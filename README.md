# Research project page template

This is a template you can use to build a project page for your research paper, adapted from the original [Nerfies page](https://nerfies.github.io/). It's designed to be easy to set up for those without web development experience, but web developers will appreciate that it's flexible and built with modern, familiar technologies. See a live demo of the template [here](https://research-template.roman.technology).

## Features

- Easily edit the content in Markdown instead of HTML.

- Includes out-of-the-box components for figures, LaTeX, code blocks (with syntax highlighting), videos, 3D objects, and a figure comparison slider.
- Add custom components using HTML or even other web frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.
- Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Usage

Want help setting it up? Please schedule a call with me [here](https://cal.com/romanhauksson/meeting), and I'll personally walk you through making your project page live! I want to talk to potential users to figure out pain points and features to add.

1. Click "Use this template" to make a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. Alternatively, you can click one of the buttons below to quickly begin deploying a copy with Vercel or Netlify. To use GitHub Pages instead (recommended), see step 7.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRomanHauksson%2Facademic-project-astro-template) [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/romanhauksson/academic-project-astro-template)

2. Clone your repository.
3. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) if you haven't already. Make sure you're using version 24 or later, which you can check by running `node --version`. To manage versions, you can use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): `nvm install 24 && nvm use 24`.
4. Run `npm install` from the root of the project to install the dependencies.
5. Edit the content in `/src/pages/index.mdx`. You should use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – or one of its forks, like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) – so you can take advantage of the extensions I recommend in `.vscode/extensions.json`.
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server, then open `http://localhost:4321` in your browser to see a live preview of your page while you edit it.
7. To deploy your site to the web, you need to enable GitHub Pages for the GitHub repository. Click on the **Settings** tab, then go to **Pages** (under the **Code and automation** section). Using the dropdown, change **Source** from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions".
8. Whenever you push to the `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/astro.yml` will automatically build and deploy your site to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`. No other configuration is necessary!

## Alternative templates

- [Clarity: A Minimalist Website Template for AI Research](https://shikun.io/projects/clarity) by Shikun Liu. Beautiful and careful design that's distinct from the original Nerfies page. Editable via an HTML template and SCSS.
- [Academic Project Page Template](https://denkiwakame.github.io/academic-project-template/) by Mai Nishimura. Built with React and UIKit and editable with Markdown in a YAML file.
